                    At the beginning of the internet, a huge number of websites were created and held tons of information, but finding
                    it was time-consuming and difficult to navigate through. This problem was recognized by two Stanford students, Jerry
                    Yang and David Filo, who were sneakily using the internet to win a fantasy basketball league. A directory was needed
                    to search the internet for what users needed, thus “Jerry and David’s Guide to the World Wide Web” was made in
                    January of 1994. They would find websites and created and put them categories that users would look through to find
                    links on the internet to what they needed. It quickly became Yahoo, the first of its kind, a simple search engine
                    for internet users to use. But, with its success, problems were bound to arise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yahoo needed money to expand as a company and Yang and Filo were not making any revenue with it; no one was making
                    money on the Internet. Advertising was the only way to commercialize the web and with the fear of losing loyal
                    customers, in 1995 Yahoo took a risk and began taking in ads. Luckily, users and advertisers had multiplied, proving
                    that making money online was possible. Within the next year, competitors of Yahoo emerged, like Excite, who used
                    pure software to look for web pages. The competition brought out flashier add ons to their websites and ads that led
                    to unneeded things took over. Yahoo and Excite started to forget why they started in the first place, the search
                    aspect. A new way of searching the web was needed, signalling the start of Google.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Google was a search engine with its beginnings also starting at Stanford University. This infinite search engine was
                    created by students Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1998. It became so successful, but they needed support to continue
                    running. After every search company turned down Google, even Excite, the creators were desperate, which is when
                    investor, Andy Bechtolsheim, gave them $100,000 for Google and more investors saw this and continued to put in
                    money. This money wasn’t enough; Google needed ads to become a profitable company. Page and Brin found an
                    advertising idea from Bill Gross’ Overture, which used keywords and sponsored links to handle billions of
                    microtransactions. Before using the idea, Google wanted to work together and blend ideas, but like most deals, it
                    didn’t work out. Soon after, Google released a new version with an idea too similar to Overture, that they were
                    brought to court. Luckily, the two sides settled and all Google had to do was tweak their idea, which laid the
                    foundation for internet advertising.

                    By the end of 1995, Microsoft released their own browser, Internet Explorer, which Gates made known that it was
                    going to be used to destroy Netscape. Microsoft’s team working with Internet explorer had many advantages with their
                    financial resources and talented coders. This allowed for them to catch up to Netscape quickly. They tracked
                    Netscape’s every move and copied it, continued releasing new versions of Internet Explorer, and worked day and night
                    to make sure that their browser would not lose. Gates even took it a step further and hired salesmen to sell the
                    browser to every Microsoft customer, who used dark, hidden tactics to stop PC manufacturers from installing anything
                    but Internet Explorer. Netscape struggled with profits and began going downhill. Due to Internet Explorer’s growing
                    popularity and Microsoft’s billions of dollars in worth, the browser was made free with Windows, a power move by
                    Microsoft.

                    By August 19, 2004, Google had gone public in stocks and what was once a company making zero dollars in revenue
                    became a company worth 3 billion dollars. It seemed to have an unconventional way of doing business. But, Google had
                    so much success in the end. They had hundreds of dollars in trades and were able to take over many things and branch
                    out. Google holds so much more information than any other search engine out there to this day.
