                    <h1>The Invention of the Internet</h1>
                    <p>
                        In the small amount of time that the Internet has existed, it has already done many things for humanity
                        that
                        previous inventions, like the telephone and printing press, took decades to accomplish. It began with a
                        theory
                        proposed by psychologist J.C.R. Licklider, a professor at MIT, in 1950. Licklider knew that the
                        computers already
                        allowed for better communication, but he envisioned a world where all computers were connected to be
                        more useful
                        with sharing information between other computer users. During this time, computers were believed to be
                        such a sci-fi
                        concept; this idea of communication through computers seemed out of the ordinary and so imaginative that
                        it seemed
                        impossible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It wasn’t until the United States found their way into the Space Race against Russia, where computer
                        science was
                        used to help research. However, as time in the Space Race went on, the United States became more eager
                        to get
                        someone on the moon that there was no need for computer science. This allowed for the computer
                        scientists to focus
                        their attention on other research, so a grad student began theorizing and his theories contributed to
                        the idea that
                        computer communication was possible. Then on September 1, 1969, the first piece of hardware being used
                        to create
                        this network that would jumpstart the internet arrived at UCLA. Since it was an experimental computer
                        network that
                        no other computer had, it was only being used to send messages to itself. But, soon it would no longer
                        be the only
                        one, by 1971 about 18 computers were connected to the network, which was known as the ARPANET. The next
                        two decades
                        held a number of changes for this network: emails were created, a demonstration to the government was
                        held, local
                        area networks were started, and a standard for computer communication was made. Although there was
                        constant change
                        as more people connected to the network, ARPANET’s initial use was for defense research and was
                        restricted to
                        universities and labs that worked on government projects. The growth of the network was limited since
                        there weren't
                        enough users.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This all changed on June 9, 1992 when congress finally passed a bill that would open the Internet to the
                        public for
                        commercial use, and was put into effect when President Bush signed it in the following November. As soon
                        as it was
                        open to the public, the floodgates opened and many new uses were created for the Internet. The World
                        Wide Web was a
                        pivotal creation during this time, made by Tim Berners-Lee; this made it easier to find different
                        branches of
                        information. Once user-friendly access to the World Wide Web was enabled to the public in 1993, the
                        internet grew by
                        314,000%. The internet also made better use for the personal, at-home computers. What was once used for
                        simple
                        tasks, like word processing and spreadsheets, was capable of far more complex tasks while being simple
                        to use by the
                        late 90s. As time went on, 11 million domains were made and over 70 millions websites became accessible.
                        The
                        internet has allowed for instant connections to other sides of the world with just a point and click.
