            <h1>The Invention of the Internet</h1>
            <p>
                In the small amount of time that the Internet has existed, it has already done many things for humanity
                that
                previous inventions, like the telephone and printing press, took decades to accomplish. It began with a
                theory
                proposed by psychologist J.C.R. Licklider, a professor at MIT, in 1950. Licklider knew that the
                computers already
                allowed for better communication, but he envisioned a world where all computers were connected to be
                more useful
                with sharing information between other computer users. During this time, computers were believed to be
                such a sci-fi
                concept; this idea of communication through computers seemed out of the ordinary and so imaginative that
                it seemed
                impossible.

                It wasn’t until the United States found their way into the Space Race against Russia, where computer
                science was
                used to help research. However, as time in the Space Race went on, the United States became more eager
                to get
                someone on the moon that there was no need for computer science. This allowed for the computer
                scientists to focus
                their attention on other research, so a grad student began theorizing and his theories contributed to
                the idea that
                computer communication was possible. Then on September 1, 1969, the first piece of hardware being used
                to create
                this network that would jumpstart the internet arrived at UCLA. Since it was an experimental computer
                network that
                no other computer had, it was only being used to send messages to itself. But, soon it would no longer
                be the only
                one, by 1971 about 18 computers were connected to the network, which was known as the ARPANET. The next
                two decades
                held a number of changes for this network: emails were created, a demonstration to the government was
                held, local
                area networks were started, and a standard for computer communication was made. Although there was
                constant change
                as more people connected to the network, ARPANET’s initial use was for defense research and was
                restricted to
                universities and labs that worked on government projects. The growth of the network was limited since
                there weren't
                enough users.

                This all changed on June 9, 1992 when congress finally passed a bill that would open the Internet to the
                public for
                commercial use, and was put into effect when President Bush signed it in the following November. As soon
                as it was
                open to the public, the floodgates opened and many new uses were created for the Internet. The World
                Wide Web was a
                pivotal creation during this time, made by Tim Berners-Lee; this made it easier to find different
                branches of
                information. Once user-friendly access to the World Wide Web was enabled to the public in 1993, the
                internet grew by
                314,000%. The internet also made better use for the personal, at-home computers. What was once used for
                simple
                tasks, like word processing and spreadsheets, was capable of far more complex tasks while being simple
                to use by the
                late 90s. As time went on, 11 million domains were made and over 70 millions websites became accessible.
                The
                internet has allowed for instant connections to other sides of the world with just a point and click.
