                The users is the number one reason why the internet continues to run since its release to the public in the early
                nineties. One of the deepest desires of humans is communication and the internet allowed and still allows people to
                do this from their own homes. It is all about connecting individuals to each other and new information. The first
                website that allowed the users to share music was Napster, launched in 1999; users with similar music tastes were
                able to connect and formed their own web communities. Unfortunately, just after two years and millions of users,
                Napster had to be shut down due to copyright issues and illegal file trading. The shutting down of Napster broke new
                ground like the rise of Youtube and other platforms, where people were able to make their own content and share it
                with others. Thus, starting a new era of the internet, known as Web 2.0.

                Internet users were given a platform to express their creativity and indulge in their vanity, when creating content
                related to themselves, and social networking was born after the dot-com bubble. Websites like Myspace, initially
                used for sharing and accessing music, were being used by every person, band, and company. Not soon after, Facebook
                rose to fame, created by Mark Zuckerberg. Unlike other creators whose websites would grow and suddenly fall due to
                new websites emerging, Zuckerberg had a different approach. With Facebook, Zuckerberg wanted to create the ultimate
                relationship engine, since he knew that we are all bound together by a web of relationships; everyone is distantly
                connected to everyone. He even made it possible for other developers to build applications to make Facebook more
                useful. All these ideas are why Facebook was so successful and popular.

                Nowadays, there are so many ways for people to use the internet; it is constantly growing and at a rapid pace. There
                is no one person or company that controlled it, big businesses could never hope to control it. Many websites are
                made for users to post their thoughts, rants, and expertise on the internet, also known as blogging. Blogging set
                user communication free. People finally became active players on the two-way web, what the creator of the World Wide
                Web intended for it to be.
